### Step-1: Create Security Groups for Services
- &nbsp; We will create vprofile-ELB-SG first. We will configure Inbound rules to Allow both HTTP and HTTPS on port 80 and 443 respectively from Anywhere IPv4 and IPv6.
- &nbsp; Next we will create vprofile-app-SG. We will open port 8080 to accept connections from vprofile-ELb-SG
- &nbsp; Finally, we will create vprofile-backend-SG. WE need to open port 3306 for MySQL, 11211 for Memcached and 5672 for RabbitMQ server. We can check whcih ports needed fro aplication services to communicate each other from application.properties file under src/main/resources directory.We also need to open commucation AllTraffic from own SecGrp for backend services to communicate with each other.
